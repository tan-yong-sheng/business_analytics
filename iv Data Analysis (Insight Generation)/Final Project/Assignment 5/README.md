# Fast Food Marketing Campaign A/B Test

The project involves a fast-food chain plans to add a new item to its menu. However, they are still undecided between three possible marketing campaigns for promoting the new product.  In order to determine which promotion has the greatest effect on sales, the new item is introduced at locations in several randomly selected markets. A different promotion is used at each location, and the weekly sales of the new item are recorded for the first four weeks.

We will employ an A/B testing which Promotion 1 serving as the control group and Promotions 2 and 3 as the experimental groups (challengers). We'll find the most effective marketing strategy among the three promotion types.

|                   | Basic metadata exploration and data columns to variable type have been mapped out clearly               | 5      |
|                   | At least 10 questions are asked and these are related to the business case                               | 5      |
|                   | The student has analyzed the data using univariate analysis and written his insights                     | 5      |
|                   | The student has analyzed the data using bivariate analysis and written his insights                       | 5      |

|                   | The student has used different elements to describe the graph(labels for each axis, legend if required, title, aesthetics - styles, colors, size, etc.) | 5      |
|                   | Use of statistics - Measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode, quartiles), spread (standard deviation, variance, range, IQR), Shape (Kurtosis, Skewness, and Modality), and Frequencies, Co-occurrences, and/or other statistical analysis method | 5      |
