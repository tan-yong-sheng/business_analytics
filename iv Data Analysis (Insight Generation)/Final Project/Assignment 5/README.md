# Fast Food Marketing Campaign A/B Test
Created by [Tan Yong Sheng](https://tanyongsheng.net/)

The project involves a fast-food chain plans to add a new item to its menu. However, they are still undecided between three possible marketing campaigns for promoting the new product.  In order to determine which promotion has the greatest effect on sales, the new item is introduced at locations in several randomly selected markets. A different promotion is used at each location, and the weekly sales of the new item are recorded for the first four weeks.

We will employ an A/B testing which Promotion 1 serving as the control group and Promotions 2 and 3 as the experimental groups (challengers). We'll find the most effective marketing strategy among the three promotion types.
