## Data Wrangling Project: Sharks Attack Dataset

=================================================

**Instructions**

Welcome to the final project of this data wrangling module! In this project, you will get a chance to work through the entire data-wrangling workflow while preparing the shark_attacks.csv file for analysis. This dataset contains very dirty data and will require a lot of work! This project is broken down into key steps of the data-wrangling process to help guide you along the process. When you are finished, save the wrangled dataset as a final_project.csv file. Submit the final project as a zip folder named final_project.zip. Make sure the zipped folder has both your wrangled dataset and this Word document within it. Best of luck!

- Are there any duplicates?
- Which columns have missing data? 
- For each column with missing data, describe the best way to handle that missing data and why.
