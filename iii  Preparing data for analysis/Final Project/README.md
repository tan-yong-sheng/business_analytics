## Data Wrangling Project: Sharks Attack Dataset
Created by [Tan Yong Sheng](https://tanyongsheng.net/)

**Instructions**

Welcome to the final project of this data-wrangling module! In this project, you will get a chance to work through the entire data-wrangling workflow while preparing the shark_attacks.csv file for analysis. This dataset contains very dirty data and will require a lot of work! This project is broken down into key steps of the data-wrangling process to help guide you along the process. When you are finished, save the wrangled dataset as a final_project.csv file. Submit the final project as a zip folder named final_project.zip. Make sure the zipped folder has both your wrangled dataset and this Word document within it. Best of luck!
