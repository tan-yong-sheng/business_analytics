## Data Wrangling Project: Sharks Attack Dataset
=================================================

**Instructions**

Welcome to the final project of this data wrangling module! In this project, you will get a chance to work through the entire data wrangling workflow while preparing the shark_attacks.csv file for analysis. This dataset contains very dirty data and will require a lot of work! This project is broken down into key steps of the data wrangling process to help guide you along the process. When you are finished, save the wrangled dataset as a final_project.csv file. Submit the final project as a zip folder named final_project.zip. Make sure the zipped folder has both your wrangled dataset and this word document within it. Best of luck!


This dataset contains around 1100 rows. Inspect the dataset. In the box below, discuss the following:
- Are there any irrelevant columns? Which ones?
- Are there any duplicates?
- Which columns have missing data? 
- For each column with missing data, describe what you think the best way to handle that missing data is, and why?
- Are there any errors? Describe any you find.
- Is there anything else that requires data cleaning attention?
