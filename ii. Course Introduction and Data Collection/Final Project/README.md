Chapter 6 - Final Project (Data Analytics Plan for Game Company)
=============================================

The goal of this final project is to combine and apply the skills learned throughout this Data Collection module. 

The task:
The company you work for is launching a new strategy game, where players must figure out different ways to complete increasingly difficult levels. The game has in-app purchases, and players can buy additional tools to help them complete the levels. The goal of the company is to grow the player base and maximise in-app purchases. Consider - how can the company leverage digital analytics?

You decide to make a proposal for your boss to use Google Analytics. To succeed, you will first need to describe how you can leverage digital analytics and what you can learn from the data. Next, specifically for Google Analytics, describe:
- What audiences could be useful to create
- What events might be useful to track
- What conversions would be valuable
- What reports would be of particular interest (standard or within the explore tool)
- Any other methods of value that could be applied with GA4
Next, explain exactly how you would go about collecting this digital data by formulating a data collection plan.

Finally, within GA4, create relevant audiences, event and conversion configurations to include at the end of your proposal to the boss, to convince her you are prepared to start collecting the data. Use descriptive names (and description for audiences) to make it clear what data your configuration will be collecting. Include screenshots of the custom configurations at the end of the proposal.
